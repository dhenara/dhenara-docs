# Command-Line Coding Assistant

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to build a command-line coding assistant using the Dhenara Agent DSL (DAD) framework.
This assistant will be able to generate code based on user requirements, analyze existing codebases, and implement
changes with precision.

## What We'll Build

We'll create a command-line coding assistant that progressively evolves through four stages:

1. **Single-Shot Implementation**: A basic agent that can handle standalone coding tasks
2. **Planning Capabilities**: Adding a planning flow to break down complex tasks
3. **Enhanced Implementation**: Improving the implementation flow with context management
4. **Coordination**: Creating a coordinator flow to manage the entire process

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a fully functional coding assistant similar to the `auto-coder` example in the
DAD framework.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this tutorial, make sure you have:

- Installed the DAD framework as described in the [installation guide](../../getting-started/installation.md)
- Completed the [Quick Start guide](../../getting-started/quick-start.md) to understand the basics
- Familiarity with basic Python programming concepts
- Set up your API keys for your preferred AI providers

## Tutorial Structure

This tutorial is divided into four parts, each building on the previous one:

1. [**Single-Shot Implementation Flow**](./single-shot.md): Build a basic agent that handles direct coding tasks
2. [**Planning Flow**](./planning.md): Add planning capabilities to break down complex tasks
3. [**Enhanced Implementation Flow**](./enhanced-implementation.md): Improve the implementation flow with better context
   handling
4. [**Coordinator Flow**](./coordination.md): Create a coordinator to manage the planning and implementation

Each part includes:

- Explanation of the concepts being introduced
- Step-by-step instructions for implementation
- Complete code examples
- Tips and best practices

## Let's Get Started!

Start with [Part 1: Single-Shot Implementation Flow](./single-shot.md) to build the foundation of your coding assistant.
