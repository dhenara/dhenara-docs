# DAD Examples Overview

This section provides practical examples of how to use Dhenara Agent DSL (DAD) for different use cases. Each example
demonstrates a specific pattern or approach, with explanations of key concepts and techniques.

## Available Examples

- [Basic Code Generation Agent](./basic-agent.md) - A simple agent that analyzes a repository, generates code, and
  implements changes
- [Multi-Step Code Review Agent](./multi-step-agent.md) - A more complex agent with multiple flows for code analysis and
  improvement
- [Collaborative Coding Agent](./collaborative-agents.md) - An advanced agent that coordinates multiple specialized
  subagents
- [Best Practices](./best-practices.md) - Practical tips and patterns for effective agent implementation

## When to Use Examples

These examples provide practical implementation patterns that you can adapt to your own projects:

- Use the **Basic Agent** pattern for straightforward, single-purpose agents
- Use the **Multi-Step Agent** pattern when your process requires distinct phases with dependencies
- Use the **Collaborative Agents** approach for complex workflows that benefit from separation of concerns
- Apply the **Best Practices** to all your DAD implementations to ensure robust, maintainable code

Each example includes complete code samples that you can use as starting points for your own agent implementations.
