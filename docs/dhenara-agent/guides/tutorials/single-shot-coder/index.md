# Single-Shot Coding Assistant

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to build a simple command-line coding assistant using the Dhenara Agent DSL (DAD)
framework. This assistant will be able to generate code based on user requirements, analyze existing codebases, and
implement changes with precision.

## What We'll Build

We'll create a _single-shot_ command-line coding assistant that progressively evolves through four stages:

1. **Single-Shot Implementation**: A basic agent that can handle standalone coding tasks

TODO: Update

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a fully functional coding assistant that take a coding task and _implement_ it
using in the DAD framework.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this tutorial, make sure you have:

- Installed the DAD framework as described in the [installation guide](../../../getting-started/installation.md)
- Completed the [Quick Start guide](../../../getting-started/quick-start.md) to understand the basics
- Familiarity with basic Python programming concepts
- Set up your API keys for your preferred AI providers

## Tutorial Structure

This tutorial is divided into three parts, each building on the previous one:
- Bringup
- Live Inputs
- Coomponet Variales

The final code of this tutorial can be found in [DAD Tutorials](https://github.com/dhenara/dad_tutorials)


## Let's Get Started!

Start with [Part 1: Single-Shot Implementation Flow](./part-1.md) to build the foundation of your coding assistant.
